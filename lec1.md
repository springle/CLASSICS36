# CLASSICS36 LEC1 - Thursday 8/25/16

## Logistics

- Get the course reader this week
- Contact student store about Airstotle Selections
- Laptops are okay :)

There will be reading assignments _twice_ a week (one for Tuesday, one for Thursday).

Over the weekend, a few guiding questions will be posted to guide the readings for the following week. These will be posted in the `Focus Questions` section on bCourses.

The night before each lecture, an outline will be posted for that lecture. 

Papers must be submitted *in class*. There are two papers, and they are short. Papers will also need to be turned in online through bCourses.

The final exam is _not_ a paper. It is entirely cummulative. A breakdown of all the topics covered in the course, as well as what to expect/review for the final, will be posted before RRR week. It should be very easy, as long as you keep up in class.

There is a participation grade, which comes from the GSIs. Discussion sections are manditory. 

## Content

Philosophy can describe a number of different endevours and subdivisions. When studying Greek Philosophy, we are focusing on the original definition of Philosophy -- "Love of Wisdom". 

The word _philosophia_ came into use at the end of the 5th century BCE (_philos_ meaning "Love of", and _sophia_ meaning "Wisdom").

What is Wisdom?

1. What are the causes of natural things? Why are things the way they are? How did anything come to be? Essentially, the knowledge of the causes of natural things (trees, animals, planets, stars, etc.).
    - Prisocratic philosophers
    - Plato
    - Aristotle
2. The knowledge of how to speak persuasively. Isocrates (a writer, a contemporary of Plato) followed this definition of wisdom. Being wise == being successful. Knowing how to speak, and how to speak in public.   
3. Knowledge of what makes for a good life. Understanding of ethics. Socrates popularized this definition of wisdom.

8th -> Early 5th Century BCE bounds the **Archaic Period**. Within this period, the 7th -> 6th Century BCE bounds the **Prisocratic Period**. Called Prisocratic because they were dealing with issues that were of focus _before_ Socrates.

Pericles (in charge of Athens, while Athens was thriving) begins the **Classical Period**. The middle of the 5th Century (450 BCE) -> 323BCE bounds the **Classical Period**:

 - Socrates
 - Plato
 - Aristotle

Alexander the Great dies in 323 BCE. 323 -> 31 BCE bounds the **Hellenistic Period**:

 - Stoics
 - Sceptics
 - Epicureum

31 BCE -> 250 CE bounds the **Post-Hellenistic Period** / **Early Empire**. 
 
 - Stoics
 - Sceptics
 - Epicurem
 - Aristotelians
 - Epictitus

250 -> 529 CE bounds the **Period of Late Antiquity**. Dominated by Platonism. Very different than what Plato originally taught, but they self-identified as Platonists. They mostly wrote commentaries on Plato and Aristotle. Platos Academy is closed, and this marks the end of Ancient Greek Philosophy.
